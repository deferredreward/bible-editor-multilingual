## Escalated / blocked on a human (not a code change Claude can land alone)

- **Apply migration `0062_book_source_kind.sql`** — local (`bible_editor_dev --local`)
  and, when the Aquifer-per-range PR lands, prod. Adds `kind TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT
  'dcs'` to `book_source_overrides` for the issue #103 follow-up (Aquifer as a
  per-chapter-range tN source). Existing rows default to `'dcs'` (no behavior
  change). The feature is inert until applied. (DEV fork only; never
  `--env production` here.)
- **Apply migration `0043_pipeline_job_source_generation.sql`** — local (`bible_editor_dev --local`) and prod (`bible_editor --remote --env production`) before relying on pipeline source stamps or `staging` book-status CAS. Code landed on `feat/scripture-repo-preferences`; D1 not applied this session.
- **Apply migration `0059_scripture_lane_carry_forward.sql`** — local (`bible_editor_dev --local`) and, when PR-2 lands, prod. Adds `mode` + `carried_forward` to `scripture_lane_replacement_books` for issue #94 carry-forward. PR-1 code (`copyBookForward` in `scriptureLane.ts`) is DORMANT — nothing calls it yet — so applying is only strictly needed before PR-2 wires startReplacement/routes/UI. (DEV fork only; never `--env production` here.)
- **Prod `DEU 27:22` TN content-dup** — 2 live PRISTINE notes, same content (occ 1, quote `שֹׁכֵב֙ עִם`,
  note "See how you translated 'lies with'…") under ids `y3oq` + `oi0y` (both valid ids — a pure
  doubling, not a digit-first id). The new reimport Guard 2 PREVENTS new doubles but does NOT remediate
  this existing pair (it's insert-time only). Remediate by soft-deleting one copy (`scripts/dedup-tn.mjs`
  or the prod verse-repair pattern: version+1 + edit_log). Found 2026-06-18 via a corpus-wide live
  pristine content-key scan (only 1 such group corpus-wide). (memory: tn-ai-duplication-roundtrip)
- **en_ust master `PSA 24:6` UST** — unclosed `\qs` Selah still malformed on master; D1 already healed (v2).
  Needs the `-be-` export branch merged to land the fix. (memory: selah-qs-malformation-psa246)
- **Prod `MIC 5:5`** — bracket/period-marker engine bugs fixed in code, but the already-stored verse
  still needs re-alignment / re-import. (memory: mic-bracket-and-period-marker-bugs)
- **AI TN doubling, master `ISA 10:29`** — remediate doubled notes via `scripts/dedup-tn.mjs`;
  D1 copy `ISA 29:30` also affected. Root fix shipped; existing rows still need the cleanup pass.
  (memory: tn-ai-duplication-roundtrip)
- **Dangling `-be-` export refs** — `DCS_SERVICE_TOKEN` can't delete branches; drifted branches must be
  cleared by hand with a maintainer PAT. (memory: export-service-token-no-delete, export-branch-no-rebase-drift)

## Lessons learned (write durable, cross-session facts here — not in chat)

For the full corpus, see the memory index at
`C:\Users\benja\.claude\projects\C--Users-benja-Documents-GitHub-bible-editor\memory\MEMORY.md`.
Highlights that bite repeatedly:

- **`user_roles` is prod's live access gate, and migrations can't skip prod.** `callbackDcsAuth`
  checks `user_roles` *before* upserting into `users`, so deleting a row revokes that account's
  ability to mint a JWT and write. Production does **not** yet have the Door43 org-roles
  adjustment that supersedes this allowlist, so the 10 editors seeded by `0016` must stay in
  `bible_editor` until org-roles lands there. Anything that changes `user_roles` membership
  therefore belongs in a hand-applied script (`scripts/prune-seeded-editors.sql`), never a
  migration — the migration set runs against every D1 in the project, including prod, so there
  is no honest "dev-only migration". Corollary: **never seed accounts in a migration**; `0016`'s
  seed block landed in every new per-org database (`bible_editor_mltest_dev` etc.), giving each
  fresh org 11 allowlisted accounts it never asked for. It now seeds only the admin.

- **Stopping a `wrangler dev` background task can orphan `workerd.exe` still bound to the port.**
  A restart then leaves *two* listeners on the same port and requests are served
  nondeterministically by the stale one — which presents as newly added routes returning 404
  (`{"error":"not_found"}`) while older routes work, and survives clearing `.wrangler/tmp`.
  Diagnose with `netstat -ano | grep ":<port> " | grep LISTENING` and look for **more than one
  PID**; fix with `taskkill //PID <pid> //F` and restart on a fresh port. Same failure shape as
  the cross-worktree port-collision trap, but self-inflicted by stop/restart.
- **`scripts/import-articles.mjs` output cannot be applied to a local D1 as generated.** Its
  `BATCH = 50` produces INSERT statements that exceed wrangler's local per-statement limit, so
  `wrangler d1 execute ... --local --file=../scripts/out/import-articles.sql` dies with
  `statement too long: SQLITE_TOOBIG` — and the failure is easy to miss because the applier still
  prints a normal-looking tail, leaving `article_units` silently at 0. Workaround for local dev:
  run the importer with `BATCH` lowered (3 works) and apply that file. The `--remote` path is
  unaffected, which is why this survived unnoticed.
- **This API is cookie-auth only** — the HTTP `Authorization: Bearer` fallback was removed (see
  the comment above the WS route in `api/src/index.ts`). Manual curl testing needs a cookie jar
  (`curl -c`/`-b`) seeded via `POST /api/auth/dev`, plus an `x-csrf-token` header (read from the
  `be_csrf` cookie) for any mutating request. A Bearer token silently yields *unauthenticated*
  requests, not a 401 you can spot.
- **Workspace roster is DB-backed as of PR-1 of #81, with a strict fail-soft chain.** `workspaces.ts`
  reads the roster from the `workspaces` registry table on the SHARED DB (migration 0058), loaded once
  per isolate by the async `primeWorkspaces(env)` that the entry points (`index.ts` fetch/scheduled,
  `exportWorkflow.ts`) await before the *synchronous* `resolveWorkspace`/`listWorkspaces`. Ordering is
  **registry → WORKSPACES env var → implicit default** and MUST never throw. Two traps that shaped it:
  (a) seed the table from the env var only, **never the implicit default** — seeding a `{slug:default}`
  row would freeze `VIEWER_ORG` (which the implicit default reads dynamically); (b) D1 returns NULL for
  absent `export_owner`, and `parseEntry` rejects a non-string/non-undefined `exportOwner`, so map
  NULL→undefined before validating. Only `status='claimed'` rows are listable; the other statuses
  (available/provisioning/failed/retired) are spare-pool lifecycle bookkeeping for later PRs.
- **RTL scripture font choice is provisional.** As of the RTL-display fix (branch
  `claude/rtl-language-display-bee8f4`), non-original RTL panes (e.g. Arabic AVD/NAV) render in the
  normal reading stack `"Source Serif Pro","Cambria","Times New Roman",serif` at the standard reading
  size — deliberately NOT the Hebrew original's enlarged SBL-Hebrew treatment (that stays keyed to
  `bibleVersion === "UHB"` alone). Source Serif Pro lacks Arabic glyphs, so Arabic falls back to
  Cambria/Times, which do cover it. **If native Arabic (or other RTL) speakers find the rendering
  ugly/unreadable, switch to an SIL font with real Arabic coverage** (e.g. Lateef, Scheherazade New,
  Harmattan) — bundle it and prepend it to the non-Hebrew branch of the font stacks in
  `web/src/components/{DocColumn,BookView,ScriptureColumn}.tsx` (the `hebrewSource ? SBL : reading`
  ternaries). Direction/alignment are already correct and language-driven (`versionIsRtl` in
  `web/src/lib/versionLabels.ts`); this is purely a glyph-quality follow-up.
- **A synthetic fallback identity for translatable content is a data-loss trap, not a kindness.**
  The note-template sync (`api/src/templateSync.ts`) originally invented a positional id
  (`<supportRef>-p<n>`) when the source sheet had no id column. Those rows are translatable, so the
  moment real ids appeared every one of them would soft-delete and re-insert blank, orphaning any
  translation done in between. Writing *nothing* until identity is trustworthy is strictly safer —
  the sync now aborts with a warning instead. Generalize: when identity is the thing you're missing,
  don't guess it; refuse to write.
- **Fresh worktree:** run `scripts/worktree-init.ps1` to junction `node_modules` from main —
  never reflexively `npm install` on a branch (it leaks deps into main). Only `npm install` in MAIN.
- **Don't kill shared dev servers.** Multiple worktrees share Chrome MCP + dev ports (5173/5174/8787).
  Pick a free port or ask; never `taskkill` a port owner. `5173` is svchost-reserved on this box — relocate vite.
- **Migrations collide across parallel worktrees.** Check `wrangler d1 migrations list --remote` after any
  schema PR; a collided migration number left prod unmigrated → list-route 500s once already.
- **PR already merged?** Before pushing, run `gh pr view --json state,mergedAt`. If merged, rebase onto main,
  branch fresh, open a new PR — do not push to the merged branch. This happens regularly.
- **Hebrew compares must go through `nfc()`** (`web/src/lib/hebrew.ts`) — UHB stores combining marks in legacy
  order; milestones come out NFC. Skipping this silently breaks alignment matching.
- **`usfm-js` parks leading punctuation/markers on the node's `text`** — markers can carry text; opening
  quotes after a marker live on the marker node, not as a sibling.
- **Export USFM puts punctuation outside `\w` (`\w earth\w*.`) on purpose** — correct uW form, not churn; don't "fix" it.
- **An env-clone helper that swaps bindings by name must resolve those bindings from the original env**, or it silently
  returns the currently-active one when re-applied (`workspaceEnv` in `api/src/workspaces.ts` bit this — fixed by always
  reading off a `BASE_ENV` reference). More generally: **per-org identity cached in a token (e.g. a `role` claim) has to
  be re-resolved when the org changes, not just at sign-in** — a workspace/org switch that only swaps the active database
  while leaving a stale claim in the session token is a privilege-escalation seam, not a cosmetic bug.
- **`node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`) works for D1 schema/trigger testing.** Node 24's built-in SQLite supports `unixepoch()`,
  `?1`/`?2` positional params, triggers with `RAISE(ABORT)`, and CHECK constraints. Use an in-memory DB + the migration
  CREATE TABLE/TRIGGER statements to unit-test schema invariants without Miniflare. Wrap multi-statement batches in
  `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` with try/catch `ROLLBACK` to match D1 batch atomicity (SQLite's `RAISE(ABORT)` only rolls back
  the current statement, not the whole transaction).
- **Any new module-level cache in `api/src` must be workspace-keyed.** With per-org workspaces
  (`worktree-feat-org-workspaces`), a cache keyed only by e.g. `"project-config"` is shared across every org
  because it lives at the Worker *isolate* level, not per-request. `getProjectConfig`'s 60s cache (and
  `catalogs`/`twlFilters`/`twlSuggest`) leaked another org's config — including `org`/`exportOrg` — after a
  switch until keyed by `WORKSPACE_SLUG`.
- **Cloudflare Workflows do not inherit the per-request env clone** — they read the raw Worker `env` via
  `this.env`, not whatever `workspaceEnv()` swapped in for the triggering request. `ExportWorkflow` rendering
  the wrong org's D1 into the wrong org's DCS repos (plus colliding `nightly-${day}` instance ids masking a
  second org's export entirely) was only caught by actually running two workspaces side by side. Same caution
  applies to anything else handed to a Workflow/Queue/alarm rather than a request closure — re-point `this.env`
  explicitly from params at the top of the handler.

- **The deployed dev worker is public — its config is deliberately hardened, don't undo it.**
  `SUPER_ADMINS` is empty in wrangler.toml's default env (local dev sets `SUPER_ADMINS=dev` in
  `api/.dev.vars` instead, which never deploys — existing checkouts/worktrees must add that line
  or workspace switching to mltest and the `/api/workspaces/pool` routes silently 403 locally);
  `DCS_SERVICE_TOKEN` is intentionally absent from the dev worker's secrets so exports fail
  closed (`no_service_token`) rather than writing to the real `BibleEditorService` DCS org
  (`DCS_EXPORT_OWNER` is the same in both envs). Known consequence: the pool routes are
  super-admin-only, so on the *deployed* dev worker they 403 for everyone — pool flows are
  local-dev-only until that's revisited (#81/#182). One accepted risk, decided 2026-08-17
  (PR #180 review, issue #182): `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=""` on the dev worker falls back to localhost
  credentialed CORS — accepted because the SPA is same-origin and the double-submit CSRF check
  limits it, and splitting the var would complicate local dev.
