// Nightly export — Cloudflare Workflow.

// Each (book × resource) is its own step. step.do persists results, so a
// transient DCS rate-limit retries that one step instead of restarting the
// whole run. A failed step that exhausts retries fails *the instance*; the
// next cron tick (or a manual /api/exports/run) starts a fresh instance and
// the unaffected resources land normally.
//
// What it produces per (book, resource):
//   1. Renders the file (TSV or USFM) from D1.
//   2. Stores it under R2 at exports/<instanceId>/<book>/<filename> for
//      inspection and as a local-only backup.
//   3. If DCS_SERVICE_TOKEN is set, commits the file to the conventional
//      unfoldingWord repo on the configured branch.
//   4. Records the outcome in export_snapshots so /api/exports can list it.
