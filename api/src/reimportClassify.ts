// How the reimport should treat an existing (non-tombstone) row when it also
// appears in the incoming master TSV. Pure decision, split out so it is unit-
// testable without dragging in bookReimport's runtime deps.
//
// The reorder-preservation invariant (the reason this is its own function):
// a TN/TWL reorder writes only sort_order via the rows.ts fast path — it does
// NOT bump version or updated_by, so the row still reads as pristine. If the
// reimport keyed "no-op" on sort_order matching (it used to: sigMatch &&
// sortMatches), a reordered-but-content-identical row looked like a pristine
// change and got its sort_order overwritten back to master file order — the
// documented HOS 11 TN / HOS 12 TWL reorder-revert bug. Order flows app→master
// (the nightly export renders D1's sort_order into TSV row order), so for those
// rows D1 is the source of truth for order and a content-identical row must
// PRESERVE its local sort_order rather than adopt file order.
//
// This preservation is SCOPED (see caller): only tn/twl (the resources with an
// in-app reorder gesture) whose row already carries a non-null sort_order.
// (twl caveat: this only preserves the row through the reimport row loop —
// canonical ULT-position order is (re)asserted afterwards by the twl canonical
// post-pass in bookReimport.runReimport, which owns twl sort_order.)
//   - tq has NO in-app reorder (its PATCH schema has no sort_order; the fast
//     path can't fire for it), so master file order stays authoritative — a
//     master-side reorder must still sync in.
//   - a NULL sort_order carries no order to preserve, so a content-identical
//     null row must still be repaired to file order (else it exports at the end
//     via `NULLS LAST`).
// Both of those fall through to the normal adopt-from-master path.
//
// "reimportable" (below) is broader than "pristine": a row the AI pipeline wrote
// but no human has since edited is also safe to overwrite from master (see
// isReimportableRow). Such a row is re-seeded AND returned to master-owned
// (updated_by → NULL); the caller writes it under a relaxed guard (version-CAS
// + re-asserted protections) and counts it as `reimported_ai` rather than the
// misleading `skipped_edited`. `aiOnly` distinguishes that case so the caller
// picks the right write guard + counter.

// True iff the reimport may overwrite this (non-tombstone) row from master.

//   2. AI-only         — updated_by set, but the latest content edit_log entry

//                        null/manual-source edit_log row, flipping this false).
// Human-owned protections still block overwrite regardless of the above: a
// tombstone (deleted_at), a note queued for deletion (trashed_at), or an
// explicit preserve/hint flag (tn). This mirrors the pipelineImport deleteUnkeptTns
// safety predicate; the caller re-asserts the same conditions at write time
// (version-CAS + flag re-assertion) so a human edit landing mid-import can't be
// clobbered.
//
// A BULK REVIEW-STATE STAMP ALSO BLOCKS OVERWRITE (issue #394, option (a)).
// The admin bulk sweep and the Aquifer bulk approve set translation_state (and
// pre_draft_json) but deliberately NOT updated_by — authorship stays with
// whoever wrote the note, matching the per-row validate helper. Without this
// test such a row still reads as pristine, so the nightly reimport rewrites its
// CONTENT from master while the 'validated' label and the now-stale
// pre_draft_json snapshot stay put: the label then describes content nobody
// approved. Option (b) (have the sweep claim updated_by) was rejected because
// it makes bulk approval claim authorship of rows the admin never wrote, and
// (c) (accept the overwrite) is the data-integrity smell the issue exists to
// remove. So the stamp — which is precisely the record that someone made a
// deliberate statement about this row — makes it non-pristine here. Content
// drift on master for such a row is reported as `skipped_edited`, the same
// visible outcome as any other human-owned row.

// ── Reissued-tombstone discriminator (issue #427, options 1 and 2) ──────────
//
// A soft-deleted tn/tq/twl row keeps its `(book, id)` PRIMARY KEY slot forever
// — the row stays, only `deleted_at` is stamped. So when master's TSV carries
// that same id, the reimport's tombstone branch (bookReimport.ts's applyTsvRows)
// declines to apply master's row, and its `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(id, book) DO
// NOTHING` would refuse it too. Both outcomes are silent: master's row simply
// never lands in D1.
//
// That silence is CORRECT for one of the two cases and WRONG for the other, and
// this function is the discriminator (the same one upstream's 2026-08-10
// production sweep used to classify all 10,645 live tombstones):
//
//   - master carries the id at the SAME reference → the row is a delete that
//     hasn't been exported to Door43 yet. Skipping is exactly what preserves
//     that pending deletion; reapplying master's copy would resurrect it on
//     every nightly run. Returns false. (4 AMO rows were in this state during
//     the sweep.)
//   - master carries the id at a DIFFERENT reference → the id has been reissued
//     to a genuinely different row (bp-assistant mints ids from a repeating
//     sequence, so collisions recur). Master's row is real, new, and being
//     dropped. Returns true. This is the 1CH 23 tQ case: six ids tombstoned at
//     1CH 5:x were reissued at 1CH 23:x and vanished, and the book's watermark
//     was stamped in-sync anyway.
//
// Deliberately compares the REFERENCE, not the content: a reissued id points at
// different scripture, which is the only signal available without reading the
// whole book. `ref_raw` is the authoritative comparison (it is what the master
// TSV's Reference column literally holds, including verse bridges like "1:2-3"
// and "front:intro"); (chapter, verse) is the fallback when a row's ref_raw is
// empty.
//
// KNOWN FALSE POSITIVE, and its cost is not small — read before touching this.
// The reference test cannot separate "the id was re-minted for a different row"
// (real loss) from "the SAME row, deleted in-app, whose Reference a Door43
// maintainer then corrected" — a re-anchor to 1:3, or a bridge widened to
// "1:2-3". The second loses nothing; the row is deleted and the delete is merely
// pending export. This function reports both as reissued.
//
// Do NOT reason about that as "worst case, a delayed export." A true positive
// here now drives an ACTUAL WRITE — see bookReimport.ts's tombstone branch,
// which reclaims the slot (issue #427, option 1): it clears deleted_at and
// overwrites the row with master's incoming content at the new reference.
// So a false positive no longer just freezes the export until a human
// intervenes (the pre-option-1 behavior); it silently un-deletes a row a
// translator explicitly deleted, at whatever reference the maintainer's
// correction happens to name. The direction is still deliberate — the
// alternative to reclaiming is leaving a D1 that is short of master, which
// (on export) DELETES rows from Door43 that master genuinely still carries,
// the original 1CH failure — but this is the sharper edge of that tradeoff,
// not a free one. When the reclaim instead LOSES its version-CAS race
// (something touched the tombstoned row between the read and the write), the
// caller falls back to `tombstone_blocked` and raiseTombstoneBlockAlert makes
// that visible; see the caller for why that residual case is expected to
// self-heal on the next sync.
//
// The 2026-08-10 production sweep found 0 reissued across 10,645 tombstones,
// which bounds how often this fires today — but it is a point-in-time shape,
// not a bound on the false-positive rate going forward.
//
// This function does NOT itself write anything — it only decides whether
// master's row should be reclaimed. Issue #427's option 1 (id reclaim) has
// SHIPPED and is the caller (bookReimport.ts's applyTsvRows) that acts on this
// verdict; this function is unchanged by that — it still only answers "same
// reference or different?", exactly as before.
//
// Pure (no D1) so it is regression-testable — see reimportClassify.test.mjs.
