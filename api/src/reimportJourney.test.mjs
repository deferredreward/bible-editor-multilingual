// End-to-end journey for issue #427's option-2 instrumentation, against the
// REAL production schema (every file in api/migrations, applied in order) and
// the REAL functions — not hand-copied SQL.
//
// Run from api/:
//   node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings src/reimportJourney.test.mjs
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and why tombstoneCollision.test.mjs alone is not enough.
// That test proves SQLite's behavior by re-typing applyTsvRows' two statements
// into the test. That proves nothing if the real SQL later drifts — and the
// single most drift-sensitive line in this whole fix is the `existing` read's
// deliberate ABSENCE of a `deleted_at IS NULL` filter. If someone "tidies" that
// filter in, a tombstoned id stops reaching the tombstone branch, the counter
// silently stops firing, and every test that re-types the SQL still passes.
// So this file drives the real applyTsvRows and the real gate.
//
// What the journey covers:
//   (a) the drop is COUNTED (tombstone_blocked) by the real applyTsvRows
//   (b) the watermark is WITHHELD, and the withhold is visible in the STORED
//       book_resource_syncs row (not merely in a return value), including that
//       the taint survives the addCounts aggregation step
//   (c) the banner is QUERYABLE from system_alerts, where the UI reads it
//   (d) the HEALTHY path still stamps origin='reimport' — no false withhold
