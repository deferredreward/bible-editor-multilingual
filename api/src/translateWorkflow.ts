// Internal translate runner — Cloudflare Workflow (docs/translate-internal-runner.md §B).
//
// Runs the bp-assistant `translate` pipeline inside this Worker for orgs that
// bring their own provider key. One instance per pipeline_jobs row
// (`translate-${workspace}-${jobId}`); one durable step per batch so a
// provider hiccup retries that batch instead of restarting the run.
//
// Step list (retry policy in brackets):
//   1. guard-and-source   [3 × 5s exp]   cancel check → fetch source TSV → slice/select
//                                        → buildBatches → R2 work/batch-NN.tsv
//   2. context            [3 × 5s exp]   context pack + scripture → R2 batch-NN-pack.md/-task.json
//   3. batch-NN × N       [2 × 30s exp,   cancel check → R2 output-reuse → decrypt key (step-local)
//                          25 min timeout] → draft+repair (llm.runBatch) → R2 batch-NN-out.tsv
//   4. merge-report       [3 × 5s exp]   whole-range checks → merge into target book →
//                                        R2 out/<file> + out/translate-report → wf_status done
//   5. record-failure     (catch-all)    wf_status failed {errorKind, error}, scrubbed
//
// The bodies live in translate/workflowSteps.ts so they are unit-testable
// without a Workflows runtime; this file only maps them onto step.do and
// decides retryable vs NonRetryableError.
//
// D1 contract: this Workflow writes ONLY current_skill / current_status /
// updated_at / wf_status_json (status.writeWfStatus). State transitions and
// output_json stay owned by pipelines.ts pollPipelineJob.

/**
 * Run a step body, converting deterministic failures into NonRetryableError so
 * the engine fails the instance instead of spending the retry budget (and, for
 * batch steps, more of the org's money) on a request that cannot succeed. The
 * `[kind] ` prefix survives the engine's rethrow into run() so record-failure
 * can still name the kind (workflowSteps.classifyStepError) — it is written on
 * BOTH paths, because a rate_limited failure that exhausts its retries needs
 * its kind recorded just as much as a deterministic one does.
 *
 * NO second constructor argument to NonRetryableError. Its runtime class is
 * `constructor(message, name = "NonRetryableError") { super(message); this.name = name; }`
 * and the Workflows engine decides fatality with
 * `err.name === "NonRetryableError" || err.message.startsWith("NonRetryableError")`.
 * Passing the kind as the name therefore made the engine treat every
 * deterministic failure as an ordinary error and RETRY it — re-billing the org
 * for a request that cannot succeed. The kind rides in the message instead.
