// Admin bulk review-state sweep (issue #296).
//
//   POST /api/books/:book/review-state        (admin only — requireAdmin)
//
// Sets the BASELINE review state for a whole chapter, a chapter range, or a
// whole book, for one resource (tn | tq). The use case is an imported body of
// work whose real status we already know — "this book was checked upstream",
// "chapters 1-5 are approved, the rest needs review" — which today can only be
// expressed one note at a time in the review UI, so the state machine ends up
// describing the importer rather than reality.
//
// ── The decisions, made deliberately (issue #296 asks for exactly this) ─────
//
// 1. NEVER-DRAFTED ROWS ARE IN SCOPE. The per-row validate helpers
//    (setTnTranslationState / setTqTranslationState in rows.ts) are guarded to
//    `translation_state IS NOT NULL` so an imported row the translate pipeline
//    never touched can't be stamped 'validated' and leak into the few-shot
//    gold. This route deliberately LIFTS that guard — those imported rows are
//    the whole point of the feature — and pays for it with the provenance stamp
//    in (3). (Owner decision, 2026-08-27: "Option 1 — bulk-approve MAY validate
//    never-drafted rows, with a provenance stamp so the AI few-shot selector
//    excludes admin bulk sweeps".)
//
// 2. IT OVERWRITES HUMAN-EDITED-BUT-UNAPPROVED ROWS. An 'edited' or 'ai_draft'
//    row in the swept range takes the target state like any other. That is the
//    point of a *baseline* setter — the admin is asserting the status of the
//    whole range — but it is a real overwrite of a translator's in-progress
//    state, so it is a documented choice, not an accident. What it never
//    touches is CONTENT: the sweep writes state columns only.
//
// 3. EVERY SWEPT ROW IS STAMPED `admin_bulk_state` (migration 0071). The AI
//    few-shot pipeline treats `validated` as human-approved gold; a bulk sweep
//    is a statement about a body of work, not a per-row review, so
//    contextExport.ts's validated-examples selectors exclude stamped rows
//    (VALIDATED_TN_EXAMPLES_SQL / VALIDATED_TQ_EXAMPLES_SQL). The stamped value
//    is the state displaced by the FIRST sweep — COALESCE(admin_bulk_state,
//    translation_state, 'none') — so a repeat sweep keeps the original
//    pre-sweep state rather than recording its own output.
//
// 4. DELETED AND TRASHED ROWS ARE NEVER TOUCHED. `deleted_at IS NULL` matches
//    every other query (a sweep must not resurrect a tombstone), and for tn
//    `trashed_at IS NULL` too: a row queued for deletion is not part of the
//    body of work being approved.
//
// 5. NO VERSION BUMP, NO AUTHORSHIP CHANGE. This mirrors the per-row validate
//    helpers exactly: a state flip is not a content edit, so `version` stays put
//    (in-flight If-Match preconditions on open editors stay valid — a sweep must
//    not turn every translator's queued outbox op into a 409) and `updated_by`
//    is left alone (standing authorship is whoever wrote the note, not whoever
//    swept it). `updated_at` does move, so the row sorts as recently touched.
//    The audit trail is edit_log, written per chapter with source =
//    ADMIN_BULK_SOURCE so a sweep is distinguishable from a translator's
//    approval.
//
// 6. SUBREQUEST BUDGET. Writes are SET-BASED — two statements per chapter (one
//    UPDATE, one INSERT ... SELECT into edit_log), not two per row — so a
//    150-chapter book costs 300 statements, batched in chunks under D1's bound
//    limits. Per-row statements would blow the Workers ~1000-subrequest cap on
//    any real book (the failure mode that has bitten this codebase before; see
//    CLAUDE.md on ExportWorkflow).
