// Global viewer read-only gate — defense-in-depth behind the per-route
// requireEditor / requireAdmin guards.
//
// A "viewer" (DCS org member who isn't on the BE-Admins / BE-Editors teams)
// may log in and read everything, but must never mutate content state. Every
// content-write route already carries requireEditor/requireAdmin; this
// middleware is the backstop so a future write route added WITHOUT a
// per-route guard fails closed for viewers instead of silently becoming
// viewer-writable.
//
// Scope rules:
// - Registered on "/api/*" only (index.ts) — non-API paths keep their normal
//   SPA/asset fallthrough for every caller, so a viewer's response never
//   diverges from anyone else's outside the API surface.
// - Only state-changing methods are gated; reads stay untouched (they are
//   deliberately unauthenticated — public-export destiny).
// - Fail closed on role: only "admin" and "editor" pass. A viewer — or any
//   unknown/future role value — is blocked. Unauthenticated requests (no
//   userId) pass through unchanged so each route's own requireAuth /
//   requireEditor keeps deciding 401 vs 403 exactly as before (and the
//   frontend's silent-refresh-on-401 flow keeps working).
// - Self-scoped, per-user writes are allowlisted by EXACT method + path
//   pattern, not by router prefix — a future unguarded write route added
//   under /api/users/, /api/workspaces/, or /api/alerts/ must be added here
//   deliberately or it fails closed. The one prefix exemption is /api/auth/:
//   that router is entirely session lifecycle (start/callback are GETs;
//   refresh/logout act only on the caller's own session; dev mint is
//   DEV_AUTH_ENABLED + localhost gated) and viewers must be able to hold a
//   session.
