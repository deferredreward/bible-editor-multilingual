# Spare-pool D1 provisioning (issue #81)

How a new Door43 org gets its own D1 database in this deployment. The model is
**spare-pool**: pre-provision empty, migrated D1 databases, and claim one for an
org at onboard. The hot path stays on **native Cloudflare bindings** (`env.DB_x`)
— chosen over create-a-DB-over-the-HTTP-API-at-login so request latency, local
`wrangler dev` parity, and the `If-Match` save protocol are unaffected.

The tradeoff of native bindings: a binding is fixed at deploy time. **Growing the
pool needs a redeploy** (to declare more `DB_POOLn` bindings). **Claiming a slot
for an org does not** — it's a registry row update at runtime.

## The registry

The `workspaces` table (migration `0058_workspaces_registry.sql`, on the SHARED
DB) is the roster. Each row is one workspace/slot with a `status`:

| status | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `available` | a migrated, empty DB binding waiting to be claimed |
| `claimed` | assigned to an org; this is the only status `listWorkspaces` returns |
| `provisioning` / `failed` / `retired` | lifecycle bookkeeping (later PRs) |

`workspaces.ts` reads the `claimed` rows as the roster, falling back to the
`WORKSPACES` env var then the implicit default (see `primeWorkspaces`). It never
throws on a bad read — see PR-1.

## Adding pool capacity (operator, requires a redeploy)

> DEV FORK ONLY. Never `--env production` here; never target upstream unfoldingWord.

1. Create an empty D1 database and note its id:
   ```sh
   cd api && npx wrangler d1 create bible_editor_pool1_dev
   ```
2. Migrate it (brings it to the current schema so a claimed org starts clean):
   ```sh
   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply bible_editor_pool1_dev --remote
   ```
3. Declare the native binding in `api/wrangler.toml` (uncomment the `DB_POOL1`
   template under the `DB_MLTEST` block) with the real `database_id`. Name it
   `DB_POOLn` so the default slug derivation (`pool<n>`) applies.
4. Deploy the **dev** worker (plain `wrangler deploy`, no `--env`):
   ```sh
   npm run build:web && cd api && npx wrangler deploy
   ```
5. Register the binding as an `available` slot (super-admin session):
   ```sh
   curl -X POST https://<dev-worker>/api/workspaces/pool \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "x-csrf-token: <tok>" \
     --cookie 'be_access=<super-admin-jwt>; be_csrf=<tok>' \
     -d '{"binding":"DB_POOL1"}'
   ```

`GET /api/workspaces/pool` (super-admin) shows the whole registry with a
`bindingLive` flag per row, so you can see which `available` slots are actually
claimable versus declared-but-not-yet-deployed.

## Claiming a slot for an org

Two ways in, both landing on the same `claimWorkspace` mechanism.

### Automatic: first admin login (PR-3)

When someone signs in who is an **admin of a Door43 org that has no workspace in
the registry**, the OAuth callback claims a slot for that org and lands them in
it — no operator, no redeploy. "Admin" means membership of the org's configured
admin team (`BE-Admins`, or `DCS_TEAM_ADMIN`): being an org **Owner** in Door43
is not enough, and editors never claim — onboarding an org is an administrative
act.

**Three preconditions, all deliberate:**

1. `WORKSPACE_AUTOCLAIM = "true"` on the deployment. **Off by default.**
   git.door43.org is a public Gitea: anyone can create an org, create a team
   named `BE-Admins`, add themselves, and sign in. With this on, that self-serves
   a real workspace out of your pool — one slot per login, with no cap on
   logins. Enable it only where self-service onboarding is the point and the
   pool is expendable, and watch `[autoClaim] pool exhausted` in `wrangler tail`.
2. An **explicit roster** — at least one registry row, or a non-empty
   `WORKSPACES`. A single-org deployment has neither: its live workspace is the
   *synthetic implicit default*, which exists only while the registry is empty,
   so the first claimed row written there would become the whole roster and
   evict the deployment's own database (every `be_ws=default` cookie would then
   resolve to the newly claimed, empty one). Auto-claim refuses and logs
   `refusing to claim: this deployment has no explicit workspace roster`. Make
   the existing workspace explicit first — set `WORKSPACES` to a single entry
   describing it and deploy; `primeWorkspaces` persists it as a `claimed` row on
   first boot — and then adding a row is an addition, not a replacement.
3. **#381 must be resolved first. Do not enable `WORKSPACE_AUTOCLAIM` until it
   is.** An auto-claimed row carries no `export_owner`, and an org with no
   preset falls through `presetForOrg` → `DEFAULT_PRESET` (`en-unfoldingword`)
   → `exportOwnerFor` → the deployment's own `DCS_EXPORT_OWNER`. The nightly
   export would then render that org's D1 into the **deployment's own** DCS
   repos under the English root's repo names, using `DCS_SERVICE_TOKEN` — the
   same class of data loss as the closed #237, reached with no operator in the
   loop. Turning the flag on is what makes it reachable without one, so the
   destination question has to be settled before the switch flips, not after.
   #381 holds the options and is the owner's call; this doc is not the place
   that decides it.

- At most **one** slot per login. An admin of two un-onboarded orgs onboards the
  second on their next sign-in.
- The org is stored with DCS's own casing (read off the teams payload we already
  hold), matching the `COLLATE NOCASE` tenancy index from `0068`. The label
  defaults to the org name; an operator can relabel the row afterwards.
- Repeat logins claim nothing: the org is in the roster by then, so it isn't a
  candidate and no teams call is made for it.
- **Fails soft, always.** An exhausted pool, a DCS outage, or a D1 error is
  logged and sign-in continues against the pre-existing roster — it can never
  500 the callback. `[autoClaim] pool exhausted` in `wrangler tail` is the
  signal to add capacity (above).
- Super admins skip it: their org set is synthesized from the existing roster,
  so it never contains an unregistered org. They use the endpoint below.
- A claim can happen for an org the user does not land in this login (a `be_ws`
  cookie for another workspace still wins resolution). The org is onboarded and
  they can switch to it; the slot is spent either way.
- The claimed row gets no `export_owner`, so the workspace inherits the
  deployment's `DCS_EXPORT_OWNER` for the nightly export — see precondition 3
  above, which is why this is a blocker for enabling the flag rather than a
  footnote. Until #381 lands, an operator must set `export_owner` on every
  claimed row by hand.
- An org already held by a **non-claimed** row (`retired` / `failed` /
  `provisioning`, or a `claimed` row whose binding is no longer a live D1 here)
  is refused rather than given a spare slot: the `UNIQUE(org)` index from `0068`
  spans every status, so claiming would collide (#382). Logged as
  `[autoClaim] org "X" is held by a <status> row`; the held row is never
  silently reused. An operator retires the stale row properly, or claims for the
  org through the endpoint below.
- **Warm-isolate staleness at login is handled (login path).** The registry is
  loaded once per isolate and never expires on its own, so an org claimed on one
  isolate is invisible to an already-warm sibling isolate. Without a refresh, a
  **non-admin member** of a just-onboarded org who happened to sign in through a
  stale sibling would land on the denied page (auto-claim sees their org as a
  candidate, returns `not_admin`, and the sibling never learned the org was
  claimed elsewhere). To avoid it, auto-claim reports
  `examinedUnregisteredCandidate` whenever it examined an org it believed
  unregistered but did **not** itself claim (`not_admin` / `pool_exhausted` /
  `teams_unknown` / `org_held`), and `callbackDcsAuth` re-reads the shared
  registry (`refreshWorkspaceRegistry`) before login-time resolution. Cost: one
  registry read on the login of any user with a not-yet-onboarded org, only
  while the flag is on. Regression: the O2 case in
  `workspaceAutoClaim.test.mjs`.
- **Not covered here — the request path.** The same per-isolate staleness still
  lets a request whose `be_ws` cookie names a workspace a stale isolate has never
  heard of fall back to `list[0]` (a *different* tenant's D1), because the
  top-level `resolveWorkspace` answers an unknown slug with the first workspace.
  That predates auto-claim (it applies to manual pool claims too) and is tracked
  separately in **#418**; it is not fixed by this login-path reprime.

Code: `api/src/workspaceAutoClaim.ts`, called from `callbackDcsAuth` in
`api/src/auth.ts`. Tests: `api/src/workspaceAutoClaim.test.mjs`.

### Manual: the super-admin endpoint (PR-2)

Still available, and the only route for an org whose admin can't sign in yet:

```sh
curl -X POST https://<dev-worker>/api/workspaces/pool/claim \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "x-csrf-token: <tok>" \
  --cookie 'be_access=<super-admin-jwt>; be_csrf=<tok>' \
  -d '{"org":"NewOrg","label":"New Org","exportOwner":"NewOrgExport"}'
```

- Picks the oldest `available` slot whose binding is live, flips it to `claimed`,
  and stamps `org`/`label`/`export_owner`.
- **Idempotent**: re-claiming for an org that already owns a slot returns that
  slot (HTTP 200, `alreadyClaimed: true`) and consumes nothing.
- `503 pool_exhausted` when no live `available` slot remains — add capacity.

## Not yet built (later PRs of #81)

- Dynamic DB creation via the D1 HTTP API + a runtime migration runner (to make
  step 1–2 above a super-admin/cron action instead of a manual wrangler run; the
  binding declaration + redeploy in step 3–4 remain inherent to native bindings).
- Deprovisioning/retirement of abandoned orgs (decision: keep the data; never
  auto-hard-delete).
