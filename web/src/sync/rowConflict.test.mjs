// Tests for classifyRowPatchConflict (web/src/sync/rowConflict.ts) — the pure
// decision behind auto-healing spurious row 409s vs prompting on genuine ones.
// Regression coverage for the "TQ conflict on almost every edit, resolves by
// just clicking" report: a version bump from an unrelated concurrent change (or
// our own edit already landing) must NOT surface a conflict prompt, while a real
// same-field conflict still must.
