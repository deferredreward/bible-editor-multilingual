// Pure FIFO-ordering rules for the outbox drain: which ops share a target,
// and which of them are allowed to block their target or receive a freshly
// confirmed version. Split out of outbox.ts so these can be unit-tested
// directly (outboxTargeting.test.mjs) without needing IndexedDB or api.ts —
// api.ts's ApiError uses a TS parameter-property constructor that Node's
// `--experimental-strip-types` loader cannot erase, so outbox.ts itself can
// never be `import()`ed from a plain Node test script.
//
// See upstream issue #487: a `failed` op that will auto-revive (max-attempts
// sentinel) did not block its target, so a younger sibling op for the same
// row/verse could land first; threadVersionToSiblings then handed the
// stale failed op the fresh version, so reviveMaxAttemptsFailed (focus /
// online / auth-refresh) re-armed it with a clean If-Match and silently
// reverted the newer, already-landed content. The two predicates below are
// the fix: block on it (isMaxAttemptsBlocked) and exclude it from silent
// version-threading (eligibleForVersionThread) so it re-arms through the
// normal 409/autoheal path instead, where classifyRowPatchConflict can tell
// a genuine conflict from a spurious one.
//
// The manual path is protected by queue position, not by these predicates:
// outbox.ts's retry() flips a max-attempts-failed op's status to "pending",
// which alone makes isMaxAttemptsBlocked stop applying to it. retry()
// deliberately leaves queuedAt/seq untouched, so plain FIFO order keeps the
// retried op draining ahead of any sibling that queued while it sat failed —
// exactly as if it had never failed. Do NOT "freshen" queuedAt/seq in
// retry(): that would sort the retried op *behind* the younger sibling, the
// sibling would land first, and eligibleForVersionThread (which allows any
// pending op) would thread its fresh version straight into the retried op —
// which then lands cleanly on top of the newer content. See the Retry
// section of outboxTargeting.test.mjs.
