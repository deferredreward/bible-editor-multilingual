/**
 * GET /api/books/:book groups rows by chapter, and book front matter lands in
 * chapter 0: `refParts` in api/src/importParsers.ts maps a 'front:intro' tn ref
 * to chapter 0, so every book imported with book-intro notes gets a chapter-0
 * entry (verified against GET /api/chapters/ZEC: ids 0-14 for a 14-chapter
 * book). Counting that entry as a chapter reported OBA — a one-chapter book —
 * as "2 chapter(s) loaded", and fed chapter 0 into chapter navigation, the
 * re-pull default range, and whole-book AI translate.
 *
 * Anything that COUNTS chapters, or lists them for a chapter-scoped screen,
 * goes through these. Two deliberate exceptions, because chapter 0 is a real
 * destination there and filtering it broke both once already:
 *   • TopBar's chapter selector / prev-next — renders chapter 0 as "Intro".
 *   • Shell's book-mode chapter list — BookView has a chapter-0 "front" block.
 * Row totals (notes/questions) are deliberately NOT filtered here — intro notes
 * are real notes; only screens that can't open chapter 0 exclude them.
