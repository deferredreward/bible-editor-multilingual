// Stop rules for the bulk "Draft all with AI" run over note templates. Kept

// anything importing the hook can't be unit tested.

// Fail-fast is the load-bearing behaviour. The upstream bot endpoint can be
// down for a whole run (it currently 404s — see docs/template-quick-contract.md),
// and without a cap a "draft all" over ~200 units would fire that many doomed
// requests at it.
